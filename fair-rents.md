Well apparently [rent control doesn't work](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/rent-control/).

I have an idea for another way, please shoot holes in it!

I'm inspired by [open crowd invest platform idea](https://www.opencrowdinvest.org/de), created by [Thomas Rippel](http://www.swissbiofarmer.com/about-thomas-rippel), Project Manager Fundraising Operations of the cooperative of [Kulturland Genossenschaft](https://kulturland.de/). Listen to this interview with Thomas to hear the story of how the Genossenschaft came to be and how it works, and the huge success they had with [Der Luzernenhof ist ein Bio-Bauernhof, 30km s√ºdlich von Freiburg](https://www.luzernenhof.de/de).

We create a similar Genossenschaft, and will attract [impact investors](https://thegiin.org/impact-investing/need-to-know/) to invest their money in an idea of fairness and making the world a better place. All flats inside the builds purchased will be rented back to the tenants at cost price minus costs.

There is no way for investors to exit the investment before the duration has expired. Let's say 40 years as an example. The investor can benefit from any appreciation of land value, and swallow any losses too.
